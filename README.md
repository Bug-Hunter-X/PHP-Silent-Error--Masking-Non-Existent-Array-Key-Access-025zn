# PHP Silent Error: Masking Non-Existent Array Key Access

This repository demonstrates a common PHP error where the `@` operator is used to suppress warnings when accessing non-existent array keys.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging significantly harder.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version using proper error handling.

**Key Concepts:**
* **Error Suppression Operator (`@`):** This operator suppresses error messages, making them harder to detect.
* **Null Coalescing Operator (`??`):**  Provides a clean way to handle potentially missing values.
* **isset():**  A function to reliably check if an array key exists before accessing it.
