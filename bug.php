This code suffers from a silent failure when attempting to access a non-existent array key.  The `@` error suppression operator prevents PHP from throwing a warning or notice, masking the underlying issue.
```php
<?php
$data = ['name' => 'John Doe'];
$age = @$data['age']; // Error suppression operator
echo "Age: " . $age; // Outputs: Age: 
?>
```
